					Limitation of Liability
				</h2>

				<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
					To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will the Operator, its affiliates,
					directors, officers, employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be liable to any person for any
					indirect, incidental, special, punitive, cover or consequential damages (including, without
					limitation, damages for lost profits, revenue, sales, goodwill, use of content, impact on business,
					business interruption, loss of anticipated savings, loss of business opportunity) however caused,
					under any theory of liability, including, without limitation, contract, tort, warranty, breach of

					possibility of such damages or could have foreseen such damages. To the maximum extent permitted by
					applicable law, the aggregate liability of the Operator and its affiliates, officers, employees,
					agents, suppliers and licensors relating to the services will be limited to an amount greater of one
					dollar or any amounts actually paid in cash by you to the Operator for the prior one month period
					prior to the first event or occurrence giving rise to such liability. The limitations and exclusions
					also apply if this remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses or fails of its essential
					purpose.

					All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be exercised and shall be applicable and
					binding only to the extent that they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be
					limited to the extent necessary so that they will not render this Agreement illegal, invalid or
					unenforceable. If any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be
					illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the
					parties that the remaining provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their agreement with
					respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such remaining provisions or portions thereof shall
					remain in full force and effect.
				</p>

					courts located in California, United States, and you hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of
					such courts. You hereby waive any right to a jury trial in any proceeding arising out of or related
					to this Agreement. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
