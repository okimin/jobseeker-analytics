### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Not redirected after login?**  
  Double-check your `REDIRECT_URI` in both `.env` and Google Cloud settings.  
- **Invalid API key errors?**  
  Some Google APIs require API key restrictionsâ€”try generating a new unrestricted key for local testing.  
- **Cannot Build Docker Image?**
   Check that Docker Desktop is running and you have sufficient disk space.
- **When do I need to rebuild Docker?**
   If you change `.env` variables, you'll need to `docker compose down` and `docker compose up --build`
