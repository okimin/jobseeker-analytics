Tests for user login/onboarding flow redirects.

pages after OAuth authentication:
- Coaches → /dashboard (bypass all onboarding)
- Jobseekers with complete setup → /processing
- Jobseekers without email sync → /email-sync-setup
- Jobseekers without start date → /dashboard
- Inactive users → /error?type=account_inactive
