## **About Just A Job App (JAJA)**

**JAJA tracks your job applications automatically, no spreadsheet required.** 

Isn't tracking companies you've applied to exhausting? The emotional toll burned me out faster than the job hunt itself.

That's why I built JAJA‚Äîto automate the tedious work of tracking applications.
