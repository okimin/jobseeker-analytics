## A Single Lost Email Cost Me $40,000

After being laid off by email in 2024, I managed 46 interview pipelines from 129 applications. During a 9-interview week, a manual tracking error led to a missed interview—for a role paying $40,000 more than the offers I received.

I built JustAJobApp so this never happens to you.

## The Job Search Crisis

**2–3× More Applications:** Pre-pandemic research found job seekers sent ~12 applications per month. JustAJobApp users send 7–12 per *week*—over 2× the historical volume. That's 2× more confirmation emails, rejections, and interview threads flooding your inbox.

**7,800+ Applications Tracked:** That's 7,800+ confirmation emails, status updates, and interview requests our users no longer manage manually.

**Spreadsheets Aren't Helping:** 72% of surveyed job seekers use 3+ different apps to track their search. Moving data between emails, calendars, and spreadsheets manually is where the $40,000 mistakes happen.

## How It Works

1. **Connect your Gmail** — Secure sign-in, takes 30 seconds
2. **Apply for jobs like normal** — No browser extensions, no clipping
3. **Your dashboard updates automatically** — Confirmation emails become tracked applications

Unlike other job trackers that force you to manually "clip" every job with a browser extension, JustAJobApp is fully automated.

## Privacy Is Our Product

For a tool that reads your inbox, trust is everything. We're committed to radical transparency.

### We Don't Read Your Emails

We use a narrow search query for job-related messages only. If an email isn't from a known hiring platform or doesn't contain keywords like "application received," we ignore it entirely. Our filter list is public: see [`applied_email_filter.yaml`](applied_email_filter.yaml).

### Your Data Is Not for Sale

We use Google's paid Gemini API, which contractually forbids them from using your data to train their models. Your data is yours, and it is never monetized.

### What We Store

Only the metadata necessary to build your dashboard:
- Sender name and email
- Application status (e.g., "Interview," "Rejection")
- Timestamp, company name, job title

If our system determines an email is a false positive (not job-related), we don't store anything about it.

### Why Open Source?

Because we handle sensitive data, we believe our code should be open for public audit. More eyeballs means higher security standards.

## What People Are Saying

> *"I receive so many emails a day that I mistook one for a rejection. Later, I saw a color-coded 'Hiring Freeze' status in JustAJobApp that caught my eye. It prompted me to go back and find the email—it wasn't a rejection, but an invitation to apply for a reopened position. I would have completely missed this opportunity."*
> — **CS & Engineering New Grad, F1-OPT**

> *"I get to see the entire picture on a single dashboard... and not have to continually update a spreadsheet."*
> — **Donal Murphy, MBA, Global Events Producer**

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Are you going to read all my emails?</strong></summary>

No. JustAJobApp doesn't "crawl" your entire inbox. We use a specific search query to identify only potential job-related threads before the application even looks at the content. Our filter list is public in [`applied_email_filter.yaml`](applied_email_filter.yaml).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I use my personal email for everything. Is that okay?</strong></summary>

Yes. We only access emails matching our pre-defined filters—specific sender domains (like greenhouse.io) and keywords (like "application received"). Everything else is ignored entirely.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I have to use the web app?</strong></summary>

No. If you're technical, you can self-host by following the instructions above.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why is this open source?</strong></summary>

Transparency. Because we handle sensitive data, we believe our code should be open for public audit. Having "more eyeballs" ensures higher security standards.
